<h1 align="center">JR PROGRAMMER PROJECT</h1>
<h3 align="center">A project where I use what I learned in Unity classes. In our project, we load the products on the pallets onto the truck using forklifts. When we direct the forklift we choose to a pallet, it automatically starts to take it on its own. If we take the player standing on the side to a pallet, the production speed of the product there increases.</h3>
